              <br /><strong>1 the great pyramid, giza, egypt, and related themes</strong><br /><strong><br />
                a</strong><br />
              the <strong>immaterial (&#8217;superior&#8217;) pyramid</strong> &#8211; whose top is &#8217;intact&#8217;, its bottom level 
              being where the two inner passages meet &#8211; is the built 
              pyramid&#8217;s spiritual counterpart and, thus, its most 
              important reference as to symbolic and spiritual interpretations.</span><br /><strong>b</strong><br />
              the <strong>secret (&#8217;universal&#8217;) cubit</strong> (uc) of about 51.487 cm, or about 9 mm shorter than the cubit-in-use 
              (the royal cubit), is explained and confirmed as 1/216 of
              the &#8216;way to the middle&#8217; &#8211; the horizontal 
              distance from the superior pyramid&#8217;s outline to its 
              centre. 216 is 6x6x6, thus mentioning 6 as the basic number 
              of sacred measurement (1x2x3 = 1+2+3)<br />
              thus making the entire perimeter of the superior pyramid 1728 
              uc.<br />              <strong>c</strong><br />
              the<strong> angular unit</strong> of <strong>1aa</strong> = 1/100 deg &#8211; explaining the average exterior gradient 
              angle as 5184aa, which is three times the perimeter of the 
              superior pyramid, 1728 (uc). 5184, being 72x72, thus mentions 
              72 as a key symbol concerning the great pyramid.<br />              <strong>d</strong><br />
              this fact is supported by the vertical dimension of the upper 
              ascending passage (from the &#8216;plane of transition&#8217; 
              to the foot of the central threshold), which is <strong>72 
                uc</strong> (see<strong> b</strong>). <br />
              the symbolical role of the figure 72 is stressed by both ascending 
              passages, which had originally a gradient angle of 2628aa 
              (= 26.28 deg). 2628 is the sum 1&#8211;72.<br />              <strong>e</strong><br />
              the<strong> immaterial &#8217;capstone&#8217;</strong> &#8211; 
              being present in the superior pyramid but absent physically 
              &#8211; is the great pyramid&#8217;s exposed One-symbol and 
              thus, also, an explaining unit of measurement. the superior 
              pyramid&#8217;s volume is 3456 capstone volumes. 3456 is two 
              times 1728 (see b).<br />              <strong>f</strong><br />
              the <strong>&#8216;tree of modulation&#8217;</strong>: an 
              articulator of numerical symbols, whose yin and yang halves 
              &#8211; a branch system having 2 and 3 as base numbers - exposing 
              the above key numbers of the great pyramid, thus explaining 
              them as yin qualities.<br />              <strong>g</strong><br />
              the<strong> &#8217;plus-one code models&#8217;</strong> &#8211; 
              explaining the role of the symbol &#8216;1&#8217; in a series 
              of sacred models (the week&#8217;s 6+1, the sitting human 
              body&#8217;s 3+1, the 4+1 of pyramid geometry; the hebrew 
              temples&#8217; 2+1, the pi+1 of the &#8216;key of transition&#8217; 
              (see <strong>h</strong>), etc).<br />              <strong>h</strong><br />
              the<strong> &#8217;key of transition&#8217;</strong> &#8211; 
              a geometric code figure explained by the circle only : by 
              &#8216;bursting&#8217; the circle creates a code of totality 
              whose characteristic is &#8216;pi+1&#8217;; appearing as an 
              explaining code in a great many different contexts (the great 
              pyramid; the geometry of sacred places and their geographical 
              interrelations; etc). <br />              <strong>i</strong><br />
              the hitherto undiscovered<strong> relationship of key levels</strong> in the landscape of<strong> Jesus&#8217;</strong> landscape 
              and the marked interior levels of the <strong>great pyramid</strong> &#8230; revealing connections of unique symbol-bearing qualities 
              and, thus, raising new questions as to the nature and meaning 
              of these striking phenomena.<br />              <strong>j</strong><br />
              also a full set of <strong>directions</strong> from the great 
              pyramid to the<strong> key places of jesus&#8217; ministry</strong> are mirrored with perfection in the pyramid&#8217;s own built-in 
              angular markings &#8211; like the direction towards bethlehem 
              (EN 2628aa), which was identified about the year 1900 as identical 
              with the pyramid&#8217;s passages&#8217; angle of ascent.

                <p class="innhold"><strong>a</strong><br />
                  the fact that a great number of sacred sites are signified 
                  by expressive relationships to <strong>earth&#8217;s geometry</strong>, 
                  whose basic references are the polar axis and the equator.<br />
                  <strong>b</strong><br />
                  the symbolical aspects of the<strong> &#8216;solar belt&#8217;</strong> (= the tropical zone), whose connection with global geometry 
                  is mirrored in several key examples of sacred geometry (like 
                  the Exodus desert temple; the Ark of the Covenant; the section 
                  of the ascending hall in the great pyramid; the angular proportions 
                  of the pentagon, etc)<br />
                  <strong>c</strong><br />
                  the strict and expressive geometries exposed by the <strong>mercator 
                    world map projection</strong>, showing that continents, continental 
                  relationships, symbolically related key places, political 
                  and religious patterns, sacred mountains and topical features, 
                  etc, often reveal striking series of expressive, explaining 
                  figures and numbers.<br />

                  of such a concept, and its precise confirmation in the great

                  <strong>c</strong><br />
                  the more than striking symbolical relationship between <strong>jesus 
                    and the great pyramid</strong>,<br />
                  demonstrated in many different ways: geographically; via great 
                  pyramid code models; topographically (when comparing landscape 
                  and passage system levels); etc.<br />
                  <strong>d</strong><br />
                  the great pyramid as a symbolical reference for the <strong>hebrew

                  the versatile roles of <strong>regular polygons</strong> (and

                  architecture, mercator map research, global models, etc. The 
                  direct relationships to the circle (or sphere) help identify
