            <p>These few pictures are developed in the darkroom of imagination. Not supported by professional knowledge,
                but, rather, floating on a surface of visions as to how things may have happened, may have been linked
                together,
                may be interpreted. Without any professional authority I declare that I see no alternative scenario,
                more able to
                draw a trustworthy picture.</p>
            <p>I do hope for comments. I came too late to present the ideas to Dr Otto Schaden, the inspiring leader of
                the KV63 excavation. I could have presented myself years ago, but fully aware of my empty voids of
                knowledge
                and correspondingly afraid of making a fool of myself I all the time postponed an open announcement.
                But television docu-mentaries gave me another solid name: Dr Salima Ikram.</p>
            <p>I’m convinced we – as humanity(?) – have entered a state of con-ception where the walls separating
                given zones of view and practice, ratio and faith, are mouldering. Thus I think – or, at least,
                hope – that this encounter of the two mentioned sources may have a chance to make a life together
                and, perhaps even, to raise children. What if KV63 chooses to be a gate to that possibility?</p>

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Semenkhkare(?) and Moses, as recorded in the book of Exodus:</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.93em ">(Chapter : verses. The text follows, in principle, the King James Bible
                version.)
                <br>5:2 (To Moses and Aaron:) «Who is Yahweh, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I do not
                know Yahweh, neither will I let Israel go ... ... »
                <br>5:8+ (To Pharaoh’s officers:) «They (Israel) are idle! ... Let more work be laid upon the men, that
                they may labour harder, and let them not regard hard words!»
                <br>7:17+ (Moses to Pharaoh:) «Thus says Yahweh, and by this you shall know that I am Yahweh: I will
                smite with the rod in my hand upon the waters in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. And the
                fish in the river shall die; the river shall stink and the Egyptians shall loath to drink of the water
                ...»
                <br>8:6+ (This happened, and after seven days Aaron, according to Yahweh’s order,) «stretched out his
                hands over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt ...» (but) the Pharaoh
                «didn’t listen to them.»
                <br>9:21+ (According to Yahweh’s order) «Moses stretched his rod towards heaven, and Yahweh sent thunder
                and hail ... and fire mingled with the hail; there had been nothing like it in Egypt since it became a
                nation ... «And Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, «I have sinned this time; Yahweh is
                righteous, and I and my people are wicked. Ask Yahweh to send no more thunderings and hail, and I will
                let you go; you shall stay no longer.» ... «and the thunders and hail ceased.» (Seeing this, Pharaoh)
                «hardened his heart, and he refused to let the children of Israel go.»
                <br>10:3+ (Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh:) «Thus says the God of the Hebrews: How long will you refuse to
                humble yourself before me? If you refuse to let my people go, I will bring locusts that cover the earth,
                so that no one will be able to see the earth. And they (the locusts) shall eat what still is spared in
                the fields and fill the houses ...»
                <br>10:16+ (Pharaoh to Moses and Aaron:) «I have sinned agaist Yahweh your God, and against you.
                Therefore I pray you: forgive my sin only this time ...» (The locusts dis-appeared, but Pharaoh) «did
                not let the children of Israel go.»
                <br>14:9+ «... The Egyptians pursued them, and the horses and chariots, his horsemen and his army,
                overtook them ...»
                <br>14:21+ « ... And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, ant Yahweh caused the sea to go back by
                a strong east wind ... and the waters were divided ... and the waters were a wall for them on both sides
                ... and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea shore ... And the people feared and believed Yahweh,
                and his servant Moses.»
