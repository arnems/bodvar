            <h2>blinking pictures in the dark</h2>
            <p>Back to the young prince. He was shocked. Nonetheless he may have hoped his vanished friend would escape
                his persecutors. Love and mutual attitudes are not easily razed out. His father, Amenhotep III, had
                accepted the boy’s warm sympathy towards the Hebrew stepson. This attitude was abruptly exchanged by
                disappointment and anger. So, why should this happen? Could it be repaired?</p>
            <p>The loss was unbearable. His walks with this elder friend had been so enlightening. A brand new
                vision of purpose and meaning was sown in the boy’s mind. This is, I think, the only way to
                understand the radical program developing in his brain. Step by step the prince saw that he had to
                act on his own, to unfold his ripening vision and, by so doing, fight the troubled memories.</p>
            <p>Moses himself knew he had spoiled any chance to give the boy a mature concept of vision. In his
                self-inflicted exile, sheep and goats, wife and children had become his lasting home. Uncertain as
                to Akhnaten’s attitude to him after the disaster, all hopes of a restored relationship were gone.
                He was gnawed by sorrow, knowing he had betrayed the boy as well as the unfolding vision ... his true
                mission.</p>
            <p>The exiled Moses was most likely quite unaware of the immense wave of radical change his role as
                mentor had caused. He hardly was aware that the new pharaoh had begun to unfold his overconfident
                program, where he challenged competing authorities and overthrew enemies, eager to realize a
                paradise by which he was to vitalize his country and people, from top to bottom.</p>
            <p>As to Moses, the encounter with Semenkhkare was the very first. The pharaoh would hardly guess this
                aged Hebrew had been his father’s childhood friend. And Moses had no need of any mention concerning
                the past. He also understood he’d have to avoid any mention of Akhnaten’s disappearance. To Moses the
                encounters with the pharaoh likely were a subtle balance between risk and hope.</p>
            <p>So, Semenkhkare didn’t identify Moses. Maybe Akhnaten had menti-oned those important childhood memories.
                But after Moses’ flight this was a theme to renounce. The old man in front of him was defi-nitely
                no anonymous anyone. He was worth listening to, but not one to be dribled by. His stubbornly
                insisting demand concerning the entire Hebrew colony was not to be met without solid friction.</p>

        <div class="rightArticle">

            <p>Semenkhkare was most likely a person in restless wavering between options, afraid to withstand the
                men of religious power. He even may have opposed and betrayed Akhnaten’s program. Even caused his
                death, although indirectly. Now, concerning the Hebrews, he both detested and depended on those
                trouble-making bastards. But, suddenly, after repeated refusals, the gate to emigration was opened.</p>
            <p>All became a disaster, though. The fatal loss in the ‘sea of reeds’ made Semenkhkare’s religious
                allies panick. Such a fool of a king! Such a disastrous misuse of men, horses and materiel! How
                produce a painless repair? How neutralize rumour and explain away those horrible facts? How restore
                the sense of pharaonic divinity? The moment may have been one of the darkest in Egypt’s history.</p>
            <p>The next step seemed obvious. The young Tuthankhamon was ready to step in, supported by an amplified
                wave of cult and glamour. Did he feel joy, or fear? Was he tempted by homage and promises, or, can
                threats or bribe have played a role? From the very first moment he was the very object of a forced
                grandeur. But what did the young king think and feel? Were his nights without nightmares ...?</p>
            <p>We don’t know the answer. But he may have known too much to make him at ease. Awkward emotions and
                observations may have been co-working agents leading him to an early death. His supporters had hoped
                he would subdue the catastrophe. Instead they filled his tomb with an unsurpassed avalanche of riches.
                Resignation was not to have the last word. But afterwaves always go on swelling.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center">+++</p>
            <p>The last word may still be in waiting. The KV63 excavation can have led to conclusions I haven’t heard
                of.
                But I do suspect that (one of) its secrets may be named ‘Semenkhkare’. A chamber smaller than many
                others
                of the kind. Having had no function as burial room, made ready but, for some reason, getting a different
                function – even from the very start. Semenkhkare was invited – but didn’t appear ...?</p>
            <p>It’s more than possible he ended his life in water. I’ve heard of no documentation, however, from
                Ferdinand de Lesseps’ Suez Canal project mentioning remains of carriages, wheels, weapens, skeletons ...
                The digging machines may have been too unsensitive, of course. Watching eyes may have focused on
                quantities, not on qualities. And more than three millennia may have made oblivion coagulate.</p>
