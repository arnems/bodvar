                <h2>chronology as key</h2>
                <p>In the great Könemann volume a chronology according to Jürgen von Beckerath, Akhnaten’s reign lasted
                from -1351 to -1334. What seems alarming is that the succeeding pharaoh, Semenkhkare, may have been his
                co-regent during the last period, about two or three years before the uproar. Akhnaten had had to accept
                another at his side – possibly a son or nephew(?), but, in any case not a friend.</p>
                <p>After Akhnaten’s fall Semenkhare demonstrated the traditional poly-theistic theologies, and most
                    likely his connection with Thebes was intimate enough. Whether he agreed positively in the getting
                    rid of Akhnaten, or – just as possibly – was paid by orthodoxy to make it happen, we may not know.
                    But the scheme is clear. His role as sole ruler seems to reveal egotistic and violent attitudes.</p>

                 <p>The next question concerns Semenkhkare’s short reign. He disap-pears from the list of pharaohs less
                     than two years after Akhnaten’s fall. This fact invites a new set of questions. Also because the
                     elect-ion of the succeeding pharaoh, the very young Tuthankhamon (a yet younger son of Akhnaten)
                     may seem an act of haste and despair. So, the questions concerning Semenkhkare seemed most important.</p>
                <p>And still we don’t know much about him. Also his name and grlory seems to vapourize. Rumour says that
                    a box containing his remains were found in Tuthankhamon’s tomb. In any case, the connected sculpted
                    portrait didn’t resemble those of Tuthankhamon. Was this Semenkhkare? Or should it (and the possible
                    included human re-mains) represent him because his own, true remains were absent?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="rightArticle">
                <p>Even what has seemed to be Akhnaten’s remains is lacking the usual pharaonic signs of celebrity. Were
                    both he and his successor hated, in spite of all difference? Or is the ignorance concerning Semenkhkare
                    to be interpreted otherwise? Had things happened that had turned popularity into aversion? What can
                    we possibly know, or, at least, guess with some probability?</p>
                <p>The contrast to the celebrations of Tuthankhamon seems to support this latter idea. There had been a
                    need, not only to hurry the election of a new pharaoh, but, also, to stress this new king’s special
                    import-ance. Perhaps not because he deserved it, but because the situation demanded such an
                    exceptional change. Having quit Egypt of rulers of dishonour would amplify the need to glorify the successor.</p>
                <p>Something had happened ... Can chronology give us a hint? Should we know of events which for some
                    reason are forgotten or ignored or – even – just as unwished as informative guides? One certain
                    event may fit in – and with great precision. It is not entirely Egyptian, how-ever. It announces a
                    possible controversy with Semenkhkare which Egyptian sources are entirely mute about.</p>
                <p>The alternative source is the Hebrew bible, the Torah. Whose first book, Genesis, concludes by
                    telling about Joseph, sold as a young slave to an Egyptian officer of the crown and ending as
                    Minister of State, in dignity next to the pharaoh. Then, in the second book, Exodus, a person named
                    Moses appears. He comes to dominate the scene there-after, continuing to do so in the next books.</p>
                <p>According to chronicle Moses most likely was born during the rule of Amenhotep II, more than twenty
                    years before Akhnaten’s father, Amenhotep III entered the throne. The conditions of the Hebrews
                    still living in Egypt had become harsh; wealthy and poor alike were treated as slaves. The men were
                    sent to work in gold-mines and other places of hard work. And all firstborne sons were to be killed.</p>
