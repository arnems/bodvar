                The theme was presented me with full weight some eight or nine years ago by one of the most ambitious books from Verlag Könemann – on
                ‘Egypt and the Pharaonic World’. Studying the list of pharaos I got aware that some minor uncertainty was still prevailing concerning dates,
                even concerning the 18th dynasty. The numbers given caught my interest, though, and a sequence of questions and ideas surfaced.
                <p>Myself I’m an architect, researcher and author – but neither archae-ologist nor egyptiologist. My special studies concerning the
                Great Pyramid started in 1977, step by step leading to some document-ations and, in 2004, to a quite extensive twin-exhibition in the
                    Bibliotheca Alexandrina: ‘The House of Memory’ (symbols & codes) and ‘Unfolding the World’ (Mercator map discoveries).
                    <p>My presentation may
                    have seemed too controversial, both concerning ideas, comments and a few non-Egyptian themes. I admit I haven’t followed well trodden tracks,
                    yet my discoveries into ‘sacred geo-metry’, as well as architectural, geographic and religious topics have been of some value ... not least by
                    indicating that phenomena that are mostly considered separate, do prove striking interconnections.
