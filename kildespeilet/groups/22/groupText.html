<p class="leftEnglish">the birth of churches</p>
What was initiated by the first apostles
came to be a manifestation of a new religion.  Was that what Jesus’ mission had
aimed at?  A religion amidst religions,
although with pioneering powers.  But
does religion reach ... beyond religion?



<p class="leftNorwegian">etablering av kirker</p>
Det som kom i gang ved apostlene ble
snart en manifestering av en ny religion
– var det dét Jesus ville skape?  Eller er
religionvesen en hindring ...?
